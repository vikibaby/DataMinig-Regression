**lab2**

lab2 is basic linear regression method applied to an existing data set(london-borough-profiles-jan2018.csv).        
For this exercise, use columns 70 and 71 (assume we start numbering columns 0), which are the values of Male life expectancy, (2012-14) and Female life expectancy, (2012-14) in different boroughs in London.


**lab3**

Data visualization :  data distribution, crosstab.      
Preprocessing data: change non-numerical data to numberical data      
Build classfication module: Linear regrassion and Decition Tree       
Evaluation: Using ROC (Reciever Operating Characteristic) to evaluate modules .


**lab4**
