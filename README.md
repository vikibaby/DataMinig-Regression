# DataMinig-Regression
There are two parts: linear regression, and perceptrons. For these exercises, you will work with a data set provided and you will also learn how to generate synthetic data setsâ€”i.e., sets of randomly generated numbers that will help you perform the tasks.

Existing_Data.py 

Existing_Data.py  is basic linear regression method applied to an existing data set. Use the data file called london-borough-profiles-jan2018.csv. This is a mixed data set with 85 different variables of various types. For this exercise, use columns 70 and 71 (assume we start numbering columns 0), which are the values of Male life expectancy, (2012-14) and Female life expectancy, (2012-14) in different boroughs in London.
